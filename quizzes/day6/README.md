# Quiz - Day 6

If you have not already done so, checkout the GitHub repository.
`quizzes/day2/quiz02.cpp` is provided as starter code, identical to
the code in the book.

Now do problem 6.7.1 Non-redundant Diamond Shape.
Take the diamond code from section 6.3.2.1 in the text and make sure
it only prints the person name once.
